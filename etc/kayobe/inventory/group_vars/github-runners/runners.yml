# Dictionary of runners to be deployed using the role.
# Each dict item can be provided with optional attributes
# * labels - provide a list of labels for a specific runner
#   overriding the contents of `default_runner_labels`
# * state - either `started`` or `absent`. By default it will
#   be started if however the runner needs to be removed
#   then setting it to `absent` will unregister the runner with
#   GitHub and remove it from the system.
# Example
# github_runners:
#  runner_01: {}
#  runner_02:
#    labels: ['foo', 'bar', 'baz']
#  runner_03:
#    state: absent
github_runners:

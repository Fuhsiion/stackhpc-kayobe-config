upgrade:
  - |
    The path used for Wazuh certificates has changed. They are now stored in
    environment directory e.g
    ``$KAYOBE_CONFIG_PATH/environments/<environment>/wazuh-certificates``
    or ``$KAYOBE_CONFIG_PATH/wazuh-certificates`` if not using
    environments. The certificates should be moved from
    ``$KAYOBE_CONFIG_PATH/ansible/wazuh/certificates`` to the new
    location.
  - |
    The ``local_custom_certs_path`` variable has been removed. Custom wazuh
    certificates should be moved to
    ``$KAYOBE_CONFIG_PATH/environments/<environment>/wazuh-certificates/certs``
    if using environments, or
    ``$KAYOBE_CONFIG_PATH/wazuh-certificates/certs`` if not.
